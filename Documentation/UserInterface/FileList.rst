Clear files
===========

There are 4 ways to clear files from the cache:

-  Topbar clear cache menu (clear all)
-  Context menu in file tree (left/right-click)
-  Options menu in file list
-  File list update hook

..  note::
    The file tree clear cache commands on folders are recursive.

    Clear the entire page cache or file cache

This option is admin-only by default. To allow for non-admin users, set user permissions accordingly.

If the menu option does not appear, check for missing Myra credentials and the setting of the feature flags:

-  :ref:`Admin only<_admin-only>`
-  :ref:`Production only<_production-only>`
-  :ref:`Domain blacklist<_domain-blacklist>`
