=================
AutoClear - Hooks
=================

Two AutoClear hooks are implemented:

-  Page update
-  File Overwrite

.. note::
    - Hooks are not affected by the :ref:`Admin Only<_admin-only>` setting
    - Hooks can be disabled via :ref:`Disable Hooks<_disable-hooks>` setting
    - Both hooks clear the cache by dispatching a
      :ref:`ClearMyraCloudCacheEvent <clear-myra-cloud-cache-event>`, see
      :ref:`events`

..  _page-update-hook:

Page Update
-----------

This hook listens on the :php:`DataHandler->clearCachePostProc` interface.

It will only clear the page itself, when the page or its elements are edited (created/updated/deleted).
It will **not** clear subpages and file resources (non-recursive).

..  _file-replace-hook:

File Replace
--------------

..  figure:: /img/context_filelist.png

Using the option "Replace" in FileList will trigger this hook. This also
clears processed files from the cache.
