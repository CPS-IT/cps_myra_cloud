AutoClear - Hooks
=================

Three AutoClear mechanisms are implemented:

-  Page update
-  File Overwrite
-  Cache tag flush

.. note::
    - Hooks are not affected by the :ref:`Admin Only<_admin-only>` setting
    - Hooks can be disabled via :ref:`Disable Hooks<_disable-hooks>` setting
    - All of them clear the cache by dispatching a
      :ref:`ClearMyraCloudCacheEvent <clear-myra-cloud-cache-event>`, see
      :ref:`events`

..  _page-update-hook:

Page Update
-----------

This hook listens on the :php:`DataHandler->clearCachePostProc` interface.

It will only clear the page itself, when the page or its elements are edited (created/updated/deleted).
It will **not** clear subpages and file resources (non-recursive).

..  note::
    When TYPO3 requests a cache tag based clear instead of a single-record
    clear (e.g. because the changed record is referenced by several pages),
    this hook forwards the request to the
    :ref:`Cache Tag Flush <cache-tag-flush-hook>` mechanism below.

..  _file-replace-hook:

File Replace
--------------

..  figure:: /img/context_filelist.png

Using the option "Replace" in FileList will trigger this hook. This also
clears processed files from the cache.

..  _cache-tag-flush-hook:

Cache Tag Flush
----------------

TYPO3 tags every cached page with cache tags (its own page ID, the
tables/records rendered on it, etc.) and flushes pages by tag whenever a
change makes them outdated - independently of, and often covering more
pages than, the :ref:`Page Update<page-update-hook>` hook above (e.g. when a
record is shared across several pages).

This extension registers its own cache (:php:`myracloud`) as a member of
TYPO3's :php:`pages` cache group. Whenever that group is flushed:

-  by cache tag, the page that was cached under that tag is cleared in Myra
   Cloud,
-  entirely (e.g. "Flush all caches"), **all** pages are cleared in Myra
   Cloud.

..  note::
    A page can only be resolved from a cache tag once it has actually been
    rendered and cached at least once. Pages that were never cached, or
    whose cache entry has already expired or been flushed, cannot be
    resolved this way.
